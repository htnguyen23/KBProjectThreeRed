Files Written by Me:

Frontend.java - Serves as the frontend for the application. This file allows 
                the user to interact with the program and provides them with
                the information they need in an aesthetically pleasing way.

Main.java - Runs the application given a command with two parameters: the data files
            needed to make sure the application works.

FrontendTests.java - Junit5 test methods that ensure that the frontend works
                     as intended.
